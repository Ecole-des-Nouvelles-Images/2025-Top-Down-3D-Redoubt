  <h1>Gameplay</h1>
</div>

**Redoubt** is a **cooperative game** in which each player controls a researcher and must **work together** to **protect** a tower.

Players must fight **enemies** using **energy weapons** and **kicks**. These weapons have an **overheating system** and must be **recharged** at the tower. Kicks simply **push** enemies back without causing damage.

Players must go to the **resources** scattered across the map and complete a **QTE to collect** them. They must then return to the tower to **deposit** the resources. Once the quota is reached, the tower increases by one **level**, causing the camera dezoom out to see further and access **new resources** needed for improvement.

When a player has no lives left, they **die**. However, they can **heal themselves** using the tower's energy.

## Power plant
After completing a tower level, the **power plant** becomes visible and must be **activated** by performing QTEs. It activates the **tower's energy**, which can be used to **recharge** your weapon and **heal yourself**.

</div>

## Game mechanics
Each player can **move**, **shoot**, **recover resources**, **improve the tower**, **reload your weapon** and **heal yourself**.
